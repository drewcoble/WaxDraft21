## Tier-based drafting is the newest trend.  
The unique, grid-oriented layout of the available players allows you to see player tiers in relation to ADP (average draft position). 
There are also multiple positional groups being displayed on the page at the same time. This means no more switching back and forth between tabs in order to compare the remaining 
depth at each position - all it takes is a quick swipe.  
  
A similar approach is taken with the teams page, where more than one roster can be viewed at a time.  
Your Team will always be displayed on the left side, and on the right side you can swipe between all the other squads in your draft.  

  
## WaxDraft was made so you can visualize your fantasy draft.  
No more boring tables with rows and rows of players, where it's easy to let the steal of the draft slip through the cracks.  
**Visualize** your draft and gain an advantage at a glance.  
While others are trying to figure out who is still available, you can be figuring out who is the most *valuable* player.  
  
#### Good luck with your drafts!
